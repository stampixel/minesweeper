# DO NOT modify abstract classes unless it is absolutey necessary, or if you don't need an abstract class (i.e. instead of having 3 seperate gmae board files + 1 abstract class, you change it so theres only 1 class, and make everything else generate dynamically).

## Make sure you document your files in some way, follow conventions. Leave a comment at the top of your file whe uploading to Google Drive explaining what you did/modified.
